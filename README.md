# React Investment Calculator

This repository features a React-based Investment Calculator, created as part of my training with Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's comprehensive React course. This application is designed to help users calculate the future value of their investments using various input parameters.

## Key Features:
### Dynamic Input Handling:
Users can input principal amount, interest rate, and investment duration to see the potential growth of their investment.
### Real-time Calculations:
The application updates the future value of the investment instantly as the user modifies any input.
### React State Management:
Demonstrates effective state management techniques to handle user inputs and calculated results dynamically.
### Component Architecture:
Utilizes functional components and showcases best practices in component structure and props passing for scalable React applications.

## Learning Outcomes:
By developing this Investment Calculator, I gained a deeper understanding of handling user inputs, performing calculations, and dynamically updating the UI in React. This project served as an excellent practice in applying React best practices, including state management and component-based architecture.
